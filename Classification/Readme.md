# ðŸš¢ Exciting Internship Experience with Bharat Intern: Analyzing the Titanic Dataset ðŸ“Š

Iâ€™m thrilled to share my recent experience as an intern with Bharat Intern, where I delved into an intriguing project: analyzing the Titanic dataset. This project was a fantastic opportunity to enhance my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

# Project Overview

During my internship, I focused on extracting meaningful insights from the Titanic dataset. Here are some of the key steps and findings from the project:

 ## Key Steps in the Analysis:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**:
 - Mounted Google Drive and extracted the dataset.
 - Handled missing values by filling in the average age and dropping the cabin column due to excessive missing data.
 - Removed duplicates to ensure data integrity.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
 - Visualized gender distribution: 577 males and 312 females.
 - Analyzed age distribution, which showed a wide range of passenger ages.
 - Investigated survival rates, revealing significant insights by gender, class, and port of embarkation.

3. **Data Visualization**:
 - Created pie charts and bar plots to illustrate the distribution of passengers by sex, survival status, and other key variables.
 - Utilized seaborn and matplotlib for clear and insightful visual representations.

4. **Model Building**:
 - Applied Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to predict survival.
 - Achieved an accuracy of ~84% with Logistic Regression and ~80% with Random Forest on test data.
 - Implemented label encoding for categorical variables and split data for training and testing.

## Insights:
- Females had a higher survival rate compared to males.
- Passengers in first class had a significantly higher chance of survival.
- Most passengers embarked from Southampton.

This project was a testament to the power of data in uncovering stories and trends from the past. It was a rewarding experience that demonstrated how data science can provide a lens to better understand historical events.

## Acknowledgment:
I am incredibly grateful to Bharat Intern for this enriching opportunity. Special thanks to the team for their guidance and support throughout the project. This experience has significantly bolstered my confidence and skills in data science and machine learning.
